# ProMan (sprint 1)

## Story

### An email from the client

```
From: Mark Big <ceo@thepartner.com>

Subject: Welcome on board for the ProMan project!

In these days everyone wants to create a new project management tool,
and we're no exception either. We'd like to implement
something similar to Trello, so we can say we have our own tool!

We call it: ProMan

Jacob, our senior full-stack developer already started to work on the project.
He made sure to have a proper backlog, and he started to work on the wireframe
of the application.

Unfortunately Jacob was late one day, he arrived to work at 9:02,
so we had to fire him. Job starts at 9am, he had to learn it.

Now it's your job to finish the project!
Send us the sprint backlog ASAP, and we'll meet at the demo!

Remember, we need completed user stories and quality work!

Mark

Oh well, another nice client.

From the attachments you see that they imagine the app as a "one pager" where all
the boards are displayed, and when one is opened then the corresponding cards are shown.
Their [screen plan](media/web-python/proman-screen-plan.png)
is not too sophisticated but seems to be a good staring point.

Of course, the customer would love to have an application which is easy to use at first
glance, functionality is straightforward and looks nice on different screen sizes if possible.
As this is [usually](media/web-python/specification-vs-reality.png) the case.
Let's get this job done.

## What are you going to learn?

- create an advanced Flask project
- practical usage of AJAX
- mastering web development
- planning the development of an advanced product

## Tasks

1. Create an overview page listing the existing boards

2. Allow the user to add new boards with public access
    - There is a "Create new board" button after opening the root url (`/`)
    - After clicking the "Create new board" button, the user can give the new board's title in an editable field
    - There's a "Save" button that saves the new board along with its title (it displays on the board's page and the board list)

3. Allow the user to change the title of any board
    - When the user clicks on the board's title, it changes into an input box where the user can input the new title
    - There's a "Save" button that saves the board's new title (displayed on the board's page and the board list page)

4. There are 4 default columns visible after opening the board
    - There are 4 columns (_New_, _In Progress_, _Testing_, _Done_) columns that indicate the statuses of cards

11. Allow the user to access the boards and cards offline like a proper PWA (progressive web app)
    - Allow the user to save the web page as a mobile application, when opened the root url (`/`) from a mobile device, that can be later opened offline

12. Allow the user to register a new account
    - There's a register link on the page after opening the root url (`/`) that leads to the registration page
